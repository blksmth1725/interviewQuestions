1. What is Node.js and what is it used for?
    - Node.js is a run-time JavaScript enviornment built on top of Chromes V8 engine.
    - It uses an event-driven non-blocking I/O model.
    - It has a package ecosystem called npm
    - Can be used to build different applications such ass web applications, realtime
      chat applications & REST API servers.
      
2. What is event driven programming?
    - Event-driven programming is the method of building our application based on events and 
      our responses to them.
    - When an event occurs, we run a callback function which is registered to the element for
      that event.

3. What is an event loop in Node.js work? And how does it work? 
    - The event loop handles all async callbacks
    - Node.js (or JavaScript) is a single-threaded, event-driven language. This means
      that we can attach listeners to events, and when said event firesm the listeners
      executes the callback we provided
    - Whenever we call a "setTimeOut()" || "http.get()", Node.js runs these operations
      and further continues to run other code without waiting for the output.
    - When the operation is finished, it recieves the output and runs our callback 
      function
    - So all the callback functions are queued in a loop, and will run one-by-one when 
      the response has been recieved

4. What is REPL in Node.js?
    - REPL stands for read-eval-print-loop
    - It is a virtual enviornment that comes with Node.js.
    - It's an enviornment that can be used to quickly test our JavaScript code.
    - You can access the Node.js REPL by opening the command prompt and typing "node"

5. What is the purpose of module.exports in Node.js?
    - A module encapsulates related code into a single unit of code and exposes the 
      inner functions to the outer world.
    - Modules allows developers to bring in functions from other parts of the code
      base.

6. What is the difference between Asynchronous and non-blocking?
    - 

7. What is Tracing in Node.js?
    - Tracing provides a mechanism to collect tracing information generated by V8,
      Node core and userspace code in a log file.
    - Tracing can be enabled by passing "node --trace-events-enabled" flag when 
      starting a Node.js application.
    - The log files produced by the enabled tracing can be opened in the 
      "chrome://tracing" tab in Chrome.

8. How will you debug an application in Node.js?
    - Node.js includes a debugging utility called "debugger". 
    - To enable it start the Node.js file with a "debug" argument followed by
      the path to the script to debug.
    - Inserting the "debugger" into the source code of a script will enable
      a breakpoint at the postition in the code.

9. Difference between setImmediate() & setTimeout()?
    - setImmediate() is designed to execute a script once the current event 
      loop phase is complete.
    - setTimeOut() schedules a script to be run after a designated amount of 
      is defined in Miliseconds.
    - The order in which the timers are executed will vary depending on the
      context in which they are called.
    - If both are called from within the main module, then the timing will be
      bound by the performance of the proccess

10. What is process.nextTick()?
    - Anytime you call process.nextTick() in a given phase, all callbacks 
      passed to process.nextTick() will be resolved before the event loop 
      continues.

11. What is package.json? What is it used for?
    - This file holds various metadata information about the project. 
    - This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to
      identify the project as well as handle the projects dependencies.
    - When someone installs our project through npm, all the dependencies 
      will be installed as well.
    - Additionally, if someone runs "npm install" in the root directory of
      our project, it will install all the dependencies to the "./node_modules"
      directory.

12. What is livub?
    - Because Node.js is single threaded the way it deals with multiple (I/O) 
      requests us by using a special library called Libuv which amongst other  
      things provied the Node.js eventloop wth "workers" which handle requests
      asynchronously.
    - Built in C language
    - Uses system kernel
    - Has multiple threads

13. What are some of the most popular Node.js modules?
    - Express,
    - async,
    - browserify,
    - socket.io,
    - bower,
    - gulp,
    - grunt

14. What is EventEmitter in Node.js?
    - All objects that emit events are instances of the EventEmitter class.
    - These objects expose an eventEmitter.on() function that allows one or
      more functions to be attached to named events emitted by the object.

15. What is the difference between readFile and createReadStream in Node.js?
    - readFile => asynchronously reads the entire contens of a file. It will
      read the file completely into memory before making it available to 
      the User.
    - createReadStream => will read the file in chunks of the default size
      62 kb which is specified before hand.

16. What is crypto in Node.js? How do you cipher the secured information in Node.js?
    - The crypto module in Node.js provides cryptographic functionality that includes
      a set of wrappers for OpenSSL hash, HMAC, cipher, descipher, sign and verify
      functions.

17. What is a callback function in Node.js?
    - A callback is a function called at the completion of a given task; this prevents
      any blocking, and allows other code to be run in the meantime.

18. What are security mechanisms available in Node.js?
    - Authentication => 
      Primary security stage in which a user is identified as permitted
      to access the application at all.
    - The identification of said user can be done via session basis or token basis
    - The difference bewteen the two is as follows : 
        - In a session-based authentication the users credentials are compared to 
          the user account stored on the server (int the event of successful validation)
          a session is started for the user.
        - In token-based authentication, the users credentials are used to generate a
          string called a token which is then associated with the user's request to
          the server.
    - Error Handling => 
      Errors messages contain the explanation of whats actually going for the user to
      understand the reason.
    - Request Validation =>
      Validation of a request refers to the checking of data for possible inconsistencies.
      Validating the incoming data types and formats and rejecting requests not 
      conforming to the set rules can be an additional measure for securing your
      Node.js application.
19. What is Passport.js?
    - Passport.js is an authentication middleware for Node.js that can be dropped into any
      Express-based web application.
