You've declared view1 with var, and you've declared view2 with let.
What's the difference? And will the last line compile?
--------------------------------------------------------------
var view1 = UIView()
view1.alpha = 0.5

let view2 = UIView()
view2.alpha = 0.5
--------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, the last line will compile.
view1 is a variable and you can reassign it to a new instance of UIView.
With let, you can only assign a value once, so the following code would not 
compile:
--------------------------------------------------------------
view2 = view1
--------------------------------------------------------------
However, UIView is a class with reference semantics,
so you can mutate the properties of view2 - which means the last line will
compile.
