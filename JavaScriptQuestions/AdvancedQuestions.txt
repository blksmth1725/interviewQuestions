1. What are arrow functions?
    New and shorter syntax for defining functions in javascript. Arrow functions can only be function expressions (NOT function declrations).

4. What is the use of promises in javascript?
    Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
    Before promises, callbacks were used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Due to the limited functionality of a callback promises were introduced to make code more managable and readable.
    PROMISES HAVE 4 STATES:
    - Pending - initial state of promise. This state represents that the promise has neither been fufilled nor rejected, it is in a pending state.
    - Fulfilled - meaning the aysnchronous operation is completed
    - Rejected - meaning the aysnchronous operation FAILED to execute
    - Settled - representing that the promise has been either rejected or fulfilled.
