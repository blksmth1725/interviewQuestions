1. What are arrow functions?
    New and shorter syntax for defining functions in javascript. Arrow functions can only be function expressions (NOT function declrations). 
    The biggest difference between a traditional function expression and an arrow function is the way they handle the "this" keyword.   
    See AdvancedExamples.js
2. Differences between declaring variables using var, let and const.
3. What is the rest parameter and spread operator?
    Both were introduced in ES6 JavaScript.
    - An improved way of handling parameters of a function 
    - Rest parameter syntax allows us to create a function that takes in a variable amount of 
      arguemnts
    - Any number of arguments will be converted into an array using the rest parameter 
    - Used by applying three dots in front of function arguments/parameters => (...)
    - See AdvancedExamples.js
4. What is the use of promises in javascript?
    Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
    Before promises, callbacks were used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Due to the limited functionality of a callback promises were introduced to make code more managable and readable.
    PROMISES HAVE 4 STATES:
    - Pending - initial state of promise. This state represents that the promise has neither been fufilled nor rejected, it is in a pending state.
    - Fulfilled - meaning the aysnchronous operation is completed
    - Rejected - meaning the aysnchronous operation FAILED to execute
    - Settled - representing that the promise has been either rejected or fulfilled.
5. What are classes in javascript?
    Classes are syntactic sugar for JS contructor functions 
    Provide a new way of declaring constructor functions in JavaScript
6. What is Object Destructuring?
    Object destructoring is a new way to extract elements from an object or an array.
    *refer to example file*
7. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?
    Is the name of behavior that occurs when using let and const in the instances that
    we try to access a variable before it is initailized.
    This usually results in a reference error during runtime.
